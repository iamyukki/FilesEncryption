# FilesEncryption
A simple files encryption app made with Python.
It implements the "cryptography" Python library to encrypt and decrypt data with a specific key.
It also implements the "Tkinter" library as a GUI of the app.
=======================================
I'm still fixing some unnoticeable bugs in it, but it still fonctions pretty good! :D
